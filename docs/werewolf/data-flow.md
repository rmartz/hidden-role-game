# Werewolf — Data Flow

## Overview

Game state lives in Firebase Realtime Database and is pre-computed per player by `GameSerializationService`. Each player receives only the information appropriate for their role and the current phase.

## Database Layout

```
/games/{gameId}/public            — game metadata
/games/{gameId}/playerState/{sessionId}   — pre-computed PlayerGameState per player
/games/{gameId}/sessionIndex/{sessionId} — maps sessionId → playerId
```

The Narrator's session is stored separately and receives a different (fuller) `PlayerGameState` than regular players.

## Game Phase State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Daytime : game created
    Daytime --> Nighttime : start-night (Narrator)
    Nighttime --> Daytime : start-day (Narrator)

    state Nighttime {
        [*] --> Phase
        Phase --> Phase : set-night-phase (advance)
        Phase --> [*] : all phases complete
    }
```

## Data Flow Per Phase

### Lobby → Game Start

1. Narrator calls the lobby API to start the game.
2. `GameInitializationService` creates the game record and assigns roles.
3. Firebase writes initial `PlayerGameState` for each session.
4. Clients receive real-time updates via Firebase `onValue`.

### Night Phase

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant N as Narrator
    participant API as Next.js API
    participant DB as Firebase RTDB
    participant P as Player

    N->>API: advance (set-night-phase)
    API->>DB: write PlayerGameState per session
    DB-->>P: onValue push (myNightTarget, teamVotes…)

    P->>API: action (set-night-target)
    API->>DB: write updated PlayerGameState
    DB-->>N: onValue push (nightActions updated)

    P->>API: action (confirm-night-target)
    API->>DB: write confirmed state
    DB-->>N: onValue push

    N->>API: advance (start-day)
    API->>DB: write resolved PlayerGameState
    DB-->>P: onValue push (nightStatus, myLastNightAction)
```

```
Narrator advances phase (set-night-phase)
  → nightPhaseOrder[currentPhaseIndex] becomes the active phase key
  → Players with that role/wakesWith receive myNightTarget, teamVotes, etc.

Player sets target (set-night-target)
  → nightActions[phaseKey] updated in Firebase
  → All players in that phase receive updated teamVotes/suggestedTargetId

Player confirms (confirm-night-target)
  → nightActions[phaseKey].confirmed = true
  → myNightTargetConfirmed becomes true for the player

Narrator reveals investigation (reveal-investigation-result)
  → nightActions[phaseKey].resultRevealed = true
  → Investigator's PlayerGameState gains investigationResult (Seer, Wizard, One-Eyed Seer, Mystic Seer, Mentalist)

Narrator starts day (start-day)
  → resolveNightActions() runs:
    1. Collect attacks/protections (Werewolves, Bodyguard, Doctor, Chupacabra)
    2. Apply Priest wards (ward absorbs attack, ward is consumed)
    3. Apply Witch action (protect or attack)
    4. Apply Altruist intercept (redirects attack onto self)
    5. Apply Tough Guy absorption (survives first attack)
    6. Apply Smite (forced death regardless of protections)
    7. Apply Spellcaster silence and Mummy hypnotize
    8. Resolve remaining attacks (protected → survived, else → killed)
  → Killed players added to deadPlayerIds
  → nightResolution stored in daytime phase
  → PlayerGameState rebuilt: nightStatus and myLastNightAction populated
```

### Day Phase

```
Players discuss and may nominate defendants (nominate-player / withdraw-nomination)
  → nominations updated for all players
  → When nomination threshold is reached, trial starts automatically

Trial flow (if nominations are enabled):
  1. Nominations → threshold reached or Narrator calls start-trial
  2. Defense phase → defendant speaks (Narrator may skip-defense)
  3. Voting phase → players cast-vote (guilty/innocent)
     - Village Idiot votes are forced guilty
     - Pacifist votes are forced innocent
     - Hypnotized votes mirror the Mummy
     - Silenced/dead players cannot vote
     - Mayor's vote counts double
  4. Narrator calls resolve-trial → guilty > innocent = eliminated
     - Clears OES lock and Priest wards for killed player

Narrator may also:
  - kill-player → immediately kills a player (for in-person trials)
  - mark-player-dead / mark-player-alive → manual dead state management
    → deadPlayerIds updated
    → Dead player's role revealed in visibleRoleAssignments for all

Narrator starts next night (start-night)
  → New turn begins; nightPhaseOrder rebuilt
  → Night fields (myNightTarget, teamVotes, etc.) cleared for all players
```

## Role Visibility Details

`visibleRoleAssignments` is built per-player from:

1. **Own teammates** — players whose role matches a `canSeeTeam` entry.
   - Werewolves see all Team Bad players.
   - Masons see all other Masons.
2. **Dead players** — roles of all dead players are revealed to everyone.
3. **Narrator** — sees all role assignments always.

Players never see their own role in `visibleRoleAssignments` (their role is in `myRole`).

## Night Actions Key Format

Night actions are stored in a `Record<phaseKey, AnyNightAction>`:

| Role type                           | Phase key                                  | Action type       |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Solo (Seer, Bodyguard, Witch, etc.) | Role ID — e.g., `"werewolf-seer"`          | `NightAction`     |
| Group (Werewolves)                  | Primary role ID — `"werewolf-werewolf"`    | `TeamNightAction` |
| Repeated group phase                | Suffixed role ID — `"werewolf-werewolf:2"` | `TeamNightAction` |

Secondary roles with `wakesWith` (e.g., Wolf Cub) participate in the primary role's `TeamNightAction` and share the same phase key; they do not have their own key.

When a group phase is repeated (e.g., Wolf Cub double-phase), each repetition uses a suffixed key (`<roleId>:<n>`). `baseGroupPhaseKey()` strips the suffix to look up the role definition. The within-night exclusion prevents the second phase from targeting the same player as the `suggestedTargetId` from the first phase.

## Witch Special Case

The Witch sees `nightStatus` with `effect: "attacked"` entries **only** when her ability has not yet been used (`witchAbilityUsed: false`). This shows the current night's attacks from all other roles (Werewolves, Chupacabra), computed from `nightActions` before the Witch acts. Once the Witch uses her ability or if `witchAbilityUsed: true`, `nightStatus` is omitted from her state.

## Wolf Cub Special Case

When the Wolf Cub is killed (via `start-day` resolution or `mark-player-dead`), `wolfCubDied: true` is set on `WerewolfTurnState`. The next time `start-night` is called, an extra Werewolf group phase with key `"werewolf-werewolf:2"` is appended to `nightPhaseOrder`, giving Werewolves two separate attack phases that night.

The second phase cannot target the same player that was the `suggestedTargetId` of the first phase (within-night exclusion). This is distinct from the cross-night `preventRepeatTarget` mechanism used by Bodyguard and Spellcaster, which prevents targeting the same player on consecutive nights (tracked via `lastTargets` in `WerewolfTurnState`).

The `wolfCubDied` flag is cleared when `start-night` consumes it to generate the bonus phase.

## Old Man Timer

When the Old Man role is in play, `start-day` checks whether the Old Man's timer has fired. The timer fires on turn `#werewolves + 2` (where `#werewolves` counts all roles with `isWerewolf`, including Wolf Cub). If the Old Man is still alive and was **not** attacked that same night, they die peacefully — the resolution emits a kill event with `attackedBy: [OLD_MAN_TIMER_KEY]`. If the Old Man was attacked and killed by wolves (or any other attacker), the attack takes precedence and no timer event is emitted.
